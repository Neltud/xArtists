Project: NFT Staking
----------------------------------------

DONE Specs
  1. NFT staking contract
    - stake NFTs
    - stake SFTs
    - DONE unstake penalty?
  2. Proportional reward distribution
    - supports multiple ESDTs
    - keep track of reward rates for all reward tokens
    - custom score per collection/nonce
    - distribute based on total staked score

DONE Project Setup
  - DONE Initialize project structure
  - DONE Setup dependencies
  - DONE Add basic contract structure

DONE Core Staking Implementation
  - Storage
    - DONE Staker info mapping (address => StakerInfo)
    - DONE Collection info mapping (collection => CollectionConfig)
    - DONE Global staking stats
    - DONE Total stake score tracking
  
  - Staking Logic
    - DONE Stake NFT/SFT function (single and batch)
    - DONE Unstake NFT/SFT function (single and batch)
    - SKIP Collection registration/configuration - basic interactions done
    
  - Scoring System
    - DONE Base collection multiplier
    - DONE Individual NFT trait multipliers (optional)
    - DONE Score calculation function

DONE Reward Distribution
  - Distribution Logic
    - DONE Daily reward pool configuration
    - DONE Reward accrual based on stake score
    - DONE Claim rewards function
    - DONE Planned distribution
    
  - Distribution Mechanics
    - DONE User reward calculation formula
    - DONE Anti-gaming mechanisms
    
TODO Analytics & Views
  - DONE User stake information
  - WAIT add to backend if needed
    - SKIP Collection statistics
    - SKIP Global staking metrics
    - SKIP Reward distribution history
  
DONE Testing Framework
  - Unit tests for core functions
  - Integration tests
  - Reward calculation tests
  - Edge cases and security tests
    - tc: can unstake NFTs that are no longer supported (although were supported in the past)
    - tc: user stakes after reward started - should have reward rate set correctly

DONE break logic into smaller modules
